# Structured Birdâ€™s-Eye View Road Scene Understanding from Surround Video

The code will be released after the paper is published.

## Introduction
This paper proposes ORNE, an online road network estimation framework for structured BEV road scene understanding. Specifically, we propose a road network representation, i.e., representing the lane centerline as an ordered point set and the road network as a directed graph, accurately describing the lane centerline instances and lane topological relationships in complex scenes. Then, we propose an online road network estimation framework that takes on-board surround-view video as input and utilizes hierarchical query embedding to extract the BEV road network around the vehicle. Finally, we introduce a temporal aggregation module that alleviates the occlusion issue in road scenes and improves the accuracy of road network estimation by effectively utilizing any number of historical frame information.

The visualization results demonstrate that ORNE can online and accurately extract a BEV road network containing lane centerline instances and lane topological relationships around the vehicle in complex scenes.
